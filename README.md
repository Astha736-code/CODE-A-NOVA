Data Science Internship Repository

## Our mission
This repository is a launchpad for aspiring data scientists. We provide hands-on, real-world projects and learning resources across domains such as healthcare, HR analytics, and natural language processing.

## Example project: Number Guessing Game
A beginner-level Python project that demonstrates basic control flow, user input, and the use of the standard `random` library.

### What it is
A simple interactive number guessing game where the program picks a random number and the player tries to guess it. This project is ideal for students who are starting to learn programming.

### How to run

2. Clone this repository and open the project folder containing the game script (e.g., `number_guessing_game.py`).
3. Run:
   ```
   python3 number_guessing_game.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to play.

### What you learn
- Generating random numbers with Python's `random` module
